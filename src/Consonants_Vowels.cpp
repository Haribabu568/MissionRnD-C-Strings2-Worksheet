/*
OVERVIEW: Given a string, Count the number of consonants and vowels and copy them to 'consonants' and 'vowels' respectively
Notes : Neglect Space and Other Symbols .Consider Capital Letters too

E.g.: Input: "aB c" , Output: consonants should contain 2 and vowels 1

INPUTS: A string and two int pointers

OUTPUT: Modify the consonants and vowels pointers accordingly with their counts (*consonants=?? ;*vowels=??)

INPUT2: Dont Forget they are pointers ;consonants and vowels are addresses of two variables .

Output: consonants should be ??,vowels should be ??

??:Count them :)

NOTES: Don't create new string , Dont return anything ,you have been given two pointers ,copy values into those .
